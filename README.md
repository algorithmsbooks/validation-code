*Mykel J. Kochenderfer, Sydney M. Katz, Anthony L. Corso, and Robert J. Moss*

All typeset code blocks from the book, [Algorithms for Validation](https://algorithmsbook.com/validation). We also include the [code for the weighted graphs](weighted_graphs.jl) used in the book.

We share this content in the hopes that it helps you and makes the validation algorithms
more approachable and accessible. Thank you for reading!
